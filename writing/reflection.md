# Reflection by Rand Ferch

This lab required me to write a file called `ManipulateDNA`. I finished it last
week before break but I am writing the reflection now so I barely remember what
I did last week. I believe that my program is optimal for completing each of
the four mutations asked. I use string.length() where applicable instead of
hard coding magic integers. I also choose a random letter whenever possible -
including in step five, where I pick a random position to change and a random
dna letter to change it to. I had virtually no issues writing this assignment -
as usual, most of my time was spent on making sure my substring methods were
getting the correct parameters to do what I wanted them to do. (Toying with
strings is generally the most time-consuming part of each assignment I've done
that has them.)
